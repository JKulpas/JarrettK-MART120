        <h1>The ugly duckling</h1>
        A family of newborn ducklings are unwilling to accept one of their other siblings who looked bigger than them and was grey instead of yellow, like them. Hurt by the insulting remarks of everyone;
        the ugly duckling leaves home to find his place in the world. However, wherever he sets foot, he is insulted and rejected. Time passes, and he has grown into a beautiful white bird but is unaware of it. He comes across several beautiful swans who welcome him with open arms one fine day.
